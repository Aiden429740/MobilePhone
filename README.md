## Why I chose Design-1?
It is a professional look with capturing the demographic we want. It looks clean and easy to navigate and the execution of the website was really well done. It was the cleanest of the two and the ease of access to most of the website in one place for all which is better for performance.

What Design 1 has over Design 2 more ideal for it's eye-catching colours. It used more interesting colours than design 2. It keeps the attention of the viewers longer and makes the shopping experience more enjoyable. Design 2 is more vibrant and colours don't attract the same demographic due to it's lack of attraction 

# Timeline
The main page with products without information to be around the 10th of March, then this gives me until 20th to gather and put in information. I planned 8 phones so I made room for least 8 mobiles. I then planned to make a website template for mobiles, I expected the template process be be done by 8st of April. THe complete process is expected to be done by 20th of May ready for submition and gives a 2 - 4 days for feedback and make fixes.

# Reviews
##### REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN BY THE PERSON BY HAND.
## Ugnius
the basket and the log in icons are not clickable at least make them clickable
most website have where if you click the logo it would send you back to the name manu so i suggest adding that aswell
alcatel 3v page is missing some text
when you click on add to basket it sends you back to the top of the page


## Adam
The colour of the website is very unique however it is a good contrast in colours. instead of using a menu button i would make ur logo clickable that takes you back to the main menu. The account and basket button do not work and arent even clickable i would make it so you can even if it doesnt lead anywhere
You dont have the most recent phones here such as the samsung galaxy s22 you should add it king
overall it is a very good website and it looks very pleasing pop off king 

## Levente
It is colorful however you should make the login and the basket button interactable, also try to add a few more phones, it would make your website much more colorful.

# What I've done with feedback
The first lot of feedback, Levente suggested more products so I added a few more as he mentions. Adam & Ugnius suggested the logo to be clickable so I made that in Improvement 1.
## Improvements 1
* Added missing phone specifications on the Alcatel v3 page
* Added Samsung Galaxy S22 as a product.
* Made the logo clickable to lead to the main page / home page.
* Added a few more phones (iPhone 13, Redmi note 9 and Mi 11)

In the next improvement I took some more feedback and made the account buttons feel more interactive as Levente mentions.
## Improvements 2
* Added account and basket interactive and feel more like buttons.
* Fixed the product page sizes going too small
* I did not make the basket go to the top due to the page bugging out.

## Final Improvement
All 3 reviewers mentions the same things, and after the first feedback they didn't have much else to say. I did not include some colour changes as I think in my opinion the colour suits the stakeholders requirements. I did not remove the menu button as Adam as mentioned to use the Logo instead, as the user requirements needs clear indication on how to get back to the first page.

# Testing
I was testing the website and it's product phones to see if they have met the user requirements.

| Specification   | Working Status                                                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hyperlinks      | Yes, all work as intended and go to the correct link                              |
| Videos          | Yes, loads in within half a second                                                |
| Interactivity   | Yes, all interactables are functioning as intended (buttons, videos, images, etc) |
| Images Load     | Yes, loads within half a second                                                   |
| Page Load       | Practically instant                                                               |
| Page texts      | Text loads as intended and doesn't overfiill (going outside the intended box)     |
| CSS (all pages) | All CSS works and functions as intended to apply all styles for the page.         |
| Navigation bar  | Loads and functions as intended, takes less than 300ms to load.                   |

As tested in Chrome v103, these tests met all the stakeholders requirements and have no issues loading or with time defects. Nothing takes any longer than 700ms to load which the stakeholders requirements states it is bad when it is over a second loading. The images are fast and the page loading is almost instant. The videos and images render about half a second due to videos needing to communicate with Google & Youtube. Links go to the right place and none are missing their links for the pages.

## Browser tests
### Firefox v102.0
![Firefox](/src/img/Testing/Browsers/Firefox_MainPage.png)
### Chrome v103.0.5060.66
![Chrome](/src/img/Testing/Browsers/Chrome_MainPage.png)

There is a big difference between these two pages, firstly is firefox is larger in height and breaks the product list.
Chrome on the other hand is perfectly fitting and no errors in layout.

# Suitablity
This website is suitable for all audiences, it's nice and colourful to attract the viewers attention and layout is easy to follow and find specific products. It serves the purpose to purchase a brand new phone with ease.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Design 2 has many benefits like a working search bar which I would say it'll improve the user experience, a better viewing eperience and bigger nav bar for visibility. I would say this is a negative as I feel like it is over filled with options everywhere on screen, this is where Design 1 is better as it has less buttons in one page, this allows me to make it able to zoom in for visibility instead of having so much on screen at once. The placement of the search bar is also some-what awkward and in the way of products, which is bad when trying to search and the products load on the search bar. Design 2 has a bigger nav bar which creates a better viewing experience however, it fills too much on screen and shows less products which doesn't benefit the company when they need sales. Design 1 has nailed the layout sizes and proportions perfectly to fit enough phones in and have a minimal look on the nav bar.

Design 1 wins because of the simplicity and minimalistic feel. Less on screen and more in focus where Design 2 is crowded with options creating a bad user experience and design 1 giving a better experience.

# Evaluation
The design is very close to the mockup design. There were minor and major changes during it's development like the logo being interactive and going back to the main page when clicked. One thing I changed is the phone page to accommodate the video and specifications that the user requirements stated. The size of the video was very big on each page so I made them smaller in size to fit flush with the specification table. The design ended up with Phone images and Buy button on the left column and video and specification table on the right column. I also made the video bezeled edges as it looks more neat. I didn't like the videos having sharp edges so I decided early on the bezeled style. This was not meant to be in the design but ended up being a feature.

The website is fit for the purposes and meets the stakeholders and user requirements. pages load very fast within a second to keep the attraction of users, if it's more than a second to load the attention drastically goes down and are more likely to click off the website. The majority of traffick is coming from videos as they are what people watch to know if a phone is good. The customers have a clear and easy understanding what specification and brand. The website is not hard to navigate and easy to get to the phone purchase page. To the owners the website, it looks very professional and most likely keeps the business and money coming in. The developers would be cheap as the coding for the website is fairly simple, time is money so this doesn't tank too much time. The website is very maintainable as the code is all organised and clean. 

Also, using the feedback from my peers, I had to change a few things from the original design, such as in Adam's feedback, he states that "instead of using a menu button i would make your logo clickable that takes you back to the main menu." To solve this, I made it so the logo was able to take you back to the main menu page no matter what page you are in. As ugnius stated he mentioned the "alcatel 3v page is missing some text", so I went back to the phone page and personally asked ugnius which part was missing and he mentioned some specifications are missing, I went to GSMARENA for the specifications and added them into the page information. Levente mentioned I "should make the login and the basket button interactable", to fix that I made class of the buttons have an interactive glow when hovering over it with a transition. I later asked the feedback again and they preffered this version over the previous as it was much more versatile like you can click the logo to go back to the main page.


## Things I would improve on later.
after testing I felt like V2 could use size tweaking for different monitor sizes and device compatibility. V2 could use basket functionality aswell as a checkout option for in-stock products. The visibility is perfect for the user requirements, it is very easy to read and easy to zoom in or out for the user. 

The colour scheme could be improved as it is very brightly coloured. Personally, I think this could be improved better before commercial available.

Better specification table. Designed along-side the original plan to accommodate the sizes and positions for the user to have a better viewing experience.


# To be designed in V2 or later versions
* A recommended product line when on phone pages. More effectice at reaching more customers for their various needs of a phone.
* Social media outlets. The company would reach a wider audience with social media with special discounts, offers and restock.
* More products. This would give the customer more variety and different phones may appeal to them for better need requirements.
* File structure. The files are messy and need organising. the first version is messy with it's file structure and could use a massive structure upgrade in V2
* A better search function. For customers who are after a specfiic mobile and wish to purchase it. 
* Mobile Support. it is currently buggy on smaller screens which needs fixing when resizing. (V2)
* Monitor size tweaks (V2), helps with products stay in focus.
* Basket functionality (V3) for purchasabke products.
* A deals page with daily deals and sales, better for business.
